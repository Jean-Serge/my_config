# XMobar configuration

*XMobar* is a minimalistic status bar written in Haskell. It was first designed to work with the Window Manager *XMonad* (also used in this project).
In this git, you will only find the XMobar configuration file (**.xmobarrc**) and a bash script (**install.bash**) for configure it.

My configuration is not very personnal, honnestly I just have reproduce another file found on the internet (in fact I am not even able to find where).
In the future I wille make my own configuration so I could explain it and give you some tips.

## Requirements

+ I you haven't did it yet, install xmobar :


	# On ArchLinux
	pacman -S xmobar

OR

	# On Debian-based-Linux (including Ubuntu)
	apt-get install xmobar

## Installation

*(see the root **install.bash** script)*

The script will simply copy the *.xmobarrc* in your home directory.

*Note that you can just use the default XMobar configuration*

## Configuration

*This section should be filled in the future, by now I don't have really configured XMobar.*
