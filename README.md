# XMonad

*XMonad* is a lightly tiling Windows Manager (WM). Written in Haskell, it's very configurable but maybe not simplest. However you don't need to know Haskell to configure it (fortunately for me).

+ XTerm

# XMobar

*XMobar* is a minimal status bar, very effective on tiling Windows Manager like *XMonad* (see up there) or *Awesome*.
