# Vi(mproved) configuration

*Vim* is a very configurable and light text editor, it's base on the *vi* editor which is provided natively by almost all of the UNIX systems.

This repo contains configuration files for *vim*. It will install *Vundle*, a bundle manager for *vim*. 

## Requirements

+ *vim* 
+ *git* (even if it must have already been installed for cloning this project)

## Installation

(see the root **install.bash** file)

This script will copy the vim configuration to your $HOME repertory.
Then it will clone the Vundle repo and automatically install it into *vim*.

**Warning : this script will change all your vim configuration and potentially delete it!**
**You can also just use some of those files for making your own custom configuration, mine is just an example.**
 
## Configuration

You can add new *Vundle* plugins by modifying the **vim/.vimrc** file (see the Vundle.vim github repo to have some example of plugins frequently used).
